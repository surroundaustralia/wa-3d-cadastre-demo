     it contains:
    
      - Horizontal and Vertical CRS
      - Four 2D Boundary Marks for a conventional 2D parcel (its a parcel from the WA extended example)
      - 22 3D Boundary Marks for the 3D Surface Parcel and the two Duplex polyhedra
      - Four Adopted vectorObservations for the 2D parcel and 30 calculated vectorObservations for the 3D Surface Parcel and the two Duplex polyhedra
      - 50 observedVectors defining the geometries for the 2D LineStrins (2D parcel), the 3D surface, and the duplex polyhedra
      - 21 faces defining the 3D surface and the duplex polyhedra
      - 3 primary parcels - a 2D parcel and two duplex polyhedra
      - A surface TIN
      - A terrain intersection curve
